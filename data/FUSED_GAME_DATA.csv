At the beginning of the game, there is only a rock and a torch. The rest will have to be found or stolen.
Bears and wolves roam the terrain, there are diseases and radiation in the game, but the main danger comes from other survivors. The game has only a multiplayer mode. We have to engage in skirmishes and hand-to-hand fighting with them.
Players can not only compete, but also unite. Rare minutes of peace and security worth devoting to construction, equipment and strengthen the shelter, the base.
Sometimes some helicopters shoot everyone on the ground. Fortunately, helicopters can be brought down.
Weapons can be found, collected and improved. Sophisticated and more effective weapons sometimes cannot be assembled independently, you need to use drawings and find rare details, sometimes leaving very far.
Sometimes planes drop from the sky ""parcels"" with various useful staff. The falling parcel is visible from afar, the path to its fall can be long. The package can be noticed by others. A long road can be facilitated by a vehicle. For example, a boat."

The farm area needs to be cleared, and it will take time.
The hero has many different activities: plant and care for plants, raise livestock, practice crafts, extract ore, and also enter into relationships with residents of the neighbouring town to earn game money. Relationships with characters include communication, performing tasks for money, exchanging, searching for fossils and even military actions and marrying. The character is limited by the reserve of strength and health - both parameters are visible on the screen, and the game automatically puts the hero to rest if the limit of his capabilities is close.

The Arctic wilderness may be breathtakingly beautiful, thanks to the game’s artful visual style, but it is also deadly. Low temperatures, hungry animals like wolves and bears, and starvation can easily kill your character. To stay alive, he will need to learn how to light a campfire, find shelter, care about his wounds, hunt for food and protect himself in an unfriendly environment. Many necessary items in the game, including some of the weapons, need to be crafted out of the junk that you can find in the woods and in abandoned buildings.
In the story mode, called Wintermute, you control a pilot, Will Mackenzie, who was hired by his ex-wife Astrid to deliver a mysterious cargo. Eventually, his plane crashed in the woods. Will is injured, and Astrid is missing, presumably lost somewhere in the wilderness. Your goal is to survive and to rescue your companion. Wintermute follows a linear plot and only allows you to explore a limited area. However, it is recommended to start with, since it serves as a sort of tutorial to the open-world sandbox mode. This is the most popular mode, in which you are not confined to the plot and can discover new areas."

The game is set in a gritty fictional world, which resembles the Victorian era. In a war-torn world of Cairn, humanity is close to extinction.

1939	Slime Rancher	PC	Monomi Park	Monomi Park	8.1	7.8	1.22	2017	Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation	1.0	singleplayer	"In the far-distant future, far, far away in space (to be exact, a thousand light-years from the Earth), on the planet Far, Far Range, mega-corporations (they, it turns out, will be with us in the distant future!) discovered the ideal source of income, universal natural resource - Plort.
You can produce almost anything from Plot - from food and household chemicals, to solid alloys and incredibly powerful batteries.
Plort is a concentrated mucus produced by slimes - jelly-like living organisms of various species and characteristics.
Slimes, unfortunately, can not be taken to Earth to breed and receive the right amount of Plort. We have to fly to 'Far, Far Range', to build there something like a ranch for slimes and for all this to hire earthlings. One of these earthlings, the space rancheros, the brave young girl Beatrix LeBeau is the character of the game. The girl (and the player) will fly a thousand light-years in a deep sleep to equip a ranch from a Hobson Twillgers, study the planet's environment, collect, feed and breed slimes.
To get the necessary hints the girl can look for notes of the former owner - they meet on the territory of the ranch, and also communicate via Star Mail with a close friend from the Earth. In conversations with a friend, we learn a lot of things about the former, earthly life of the heroine - this information will be important.
Gameplay and economics
Slimes need to be fed, and this is important. The rest they will do themselves.
It is necessary to feed them not by anything, but by appropriate products. But slimes will produce a lot of Plort - and Plort can be sold on the market, having received currency - newbucks. For newbucks you can buy equipment for ranches and so on. The world of the game is not known until the end, it is possible and necessary to travel through it, opening up new locations, finding new slimes for the ranch, as well as food for slimes and other new resources.
From different types of slimes you can get hybrids. However, with this you need to be more careful - you can get aggressive evil slimes, which will have to be dissolved with water.
Slimes are quite diverse. Ordinary slimes are generally friendly, but they can be dangerous not because of evil will, but because of some natural features like thorns, emitted radiation or the ability to explode.
Some slimes are more productive than others, they produce more Plort. It is these slimes that are created by hybridization, since it is difficult to find them in a natural environment.
Ordinary slimes sometimes merge into a huge Gordo-slime - inside such organisms there are often valuable resources and other interesting and useful things. To get all this, you need to blow up the Gordo-slime.
Game modes
Adventure. The world is open for research, there are no serious restrictions. You can develop as you want. You can communicate with other ranchers, carry out their assignments and exchange resources with them. 
Carefree is an adventure mode that goes even easier.
The five-day trial is a mode in which you need to earn as many newbucks as possible in 5 days.
""The steel master of the ranch"" - the conditions in this mode are so complicated that it resembles a game of survival. In the mode there are unique tests that change the impression of the game."

The story is set in two time periods simultaneously. In 2017, the order of Templars has recovered an ancient artifact that will allow them to seize control over humanity. Assassins plan to get the artifact back in their hands. Layla Hassan relieves the memories of two ancient Egyptians named Bayek and Aya who create the Assassins order.
Levels are open-ended which allows both stealth or open combat approaches. Players are put in an open world in which they can complete quests in order to either progress through the story, level their character up or upgrade their equipment. The ""eagle vision"" mode was replaced by an eagle by the name of Senu. Players can use Senu to scout the area ahead and highlight enemies.
The game features a heavily revised combat system that relies on hit-box mechanics rather than pre-determined animations as it did in the previous titles. Origins focuses on introducing various types of enemies that the players will have to learn about in order to defeat them."

So you progress through similar levels killing enemies and trying to figure out what's happening. 
Besides original time mechanics, the game makes you quite vulnerable: a single enemy shot kills you making start the level again. At the same time your weaponry is limited, so to survive you need to pick enemies' guns and ammo or use melee combat.

Story
Not much story is present in the game, as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner's body, and gets back to the game's starting area. 
Gameplay
The game's heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.
Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.
The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. 
The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves."

The game is focused on non-verbal communication that should make the player more attentive to the environment surrounding him. To complete the game, you need to solve puzzles in each of the eleven island's regions and get to the mountain in the center of it. While the regions differ a little, puzzles they feature are quite similar and, as a rule, have something to do with symmetry to be solved. Puzzles are activated at the grids you can find around locations. 
There are two modes in the game. In the walking mode you can explore the island, and in the path-drawing mode you don’t move and focus on solving puzzles.
While the game’s plot is quite unclear and The Witness doesn’t give many details on the hero’s background, its key feature is the visual aspect combined with music, inspiring quotes you can hear and the meditative tone of the game in general.

There is a total of five skill trees each corresponding to playstyle and physical characteristics.

Plot
The game is set in the alternate universe that goes through its steampunk phase. It takes place in the fictional Empire inspired by the XIX-century England. The plot picks up where Dishonored 2 left it. The game follows the adventures of the previous games' villains: Billie Lurk, the captain of a sailing ship, and Daud, the assassin and the leader of The Whalers gang. They search for Outsider, an extradimensional creature from the world known as the Void who can give people supernatural abilities, and are going to kill him. Their story is intertwined with the larger events in the Empire, such as the reinstallment of the Empress, the faction rivalry and the Void influence on the world. The plot is non-linear and features multiple endings.
Gameplay
The player controls Billie Lurk from the first person view. Like its predecessors, Death of the Outsider emphasizes stealth and surprise attacks. Billie wields a dagger and eventually receives superhuman powers, such as teleportation and disguise. The expansion allows the unusually free use of these abilities. The player doesn't have to unlock them, they become available early at the game, and the energy they require regenerates automatically over time. Besides the main plot, the player can also accept side quests."

Plot
The game is set in an alternate version of USSR in the eighties. The government cannot do anything with widespread crime, so it simply ignores that. Four street fighters from a gypsy community unwillingly become the test subjects for a new drug called Necro. After escaping from the laboratory, the main character returns back to their community only to find it in ruins and the whole population becoming drug addicts. The protagonist becomes eager to get revenge on those, who did that. Further into the game, the main character starts taking Necro themselves, which causes horrible hallucinations.
Gameplay
Mother Russia Bleeds is a beat 'em up game which is largely inspired by titles such as Streets of Rage and Double Dragon.
The players advance through a level, that is divided into multiple sections. In progress further, the players have to kill every enemy they encounter in a section. At the end of each level, a boss fight is held.
Apart from hand-to-hand combat, the players can use the world's items, such as pipes, knives, bottles, and pistols. One of the defining features of the game is the health regeneration system, as the players can pump Necro out of their enemies corpses and eject them to themselves. A choice is given - regenerate health or become a berserk that has much more strength and speed.

In this alternative 1960s England, conformity is key. You’ll have to fight or blend in with the drug-addled inhabitants, most of whom don’t take kindly to people who won’t abide by their not-so-normal rules.
Discover the retrofuturistic city’s dark history as you play through the intertwined narratives of three quietly rebellious citizens of Wellington Wells, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, as they face their pasts, prepare for the future, and engage in activities that aren’t exactly status quo in the artificially enthused society.
Save 15% when you pre-purchase We Happy Few, and get instant access to the game's alpha. This allows you to experience the introduction to Arthur's narrative, explore a portion of the procedurally generated world, collect and craft items, and choose how you’ll interact with members of the Joy-obsessed society through stealth, combat, or conformity across a handful of the game’s unique events.
Plus, get the exclusive in-game Jolly Brolly weapon at launch. There’s a definite chance of pain when using this weaponized umbrella, complete with advanced blocking capabilities and trippy psychedelic interior.
Retrofuturistic 1960s England
Set in retrofuturistic 1960s England, you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people. Everything appears joyful in Wellington Wells, including its roads, its people, and its omnipresent television personality: Uncle Jack! But, it’s actually a world on the brink of collapse. Come unveil its dark history, and discover how and why its residents came to be so beguilingly happy.
Three Interwoven Narratives
Play as three flawed characters who explore their own connections to the events surrounding the rebuilding of Wellington Wells. They each have a unique storyline in which they interpret and react to the events around them in different ways. As you hide, conform, or fight back as each of them, you will encounter dark humour, a spot of hope, and even some redemption along the way.
A Dystopia of Your Very Own
In We Happy Few, no two playthroughs are alike. While the citizens of Wellington Wells will always want to ensure that you’ve taken your Joy, the procedurally generated world will ensure that your experience with We Happy Few is different and unique.  Wellington Wells is never quite like you remember it.
Take Your Joy…or Don’t. The Choice is Yours
Customize your We Happy Few experience:
•   Choose from a range of difficulties for new and experienced players alike,
•   Play through the story, or make your own story by customizing the sandbox,

Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat. Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world. Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries. Permadeath.

Each character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks. Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer. Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior. A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat. Three late game crises – a war between noble houses, a greenskin invasion and an undead scourge – add a looming threat.

10874	The Turing Test	PC	Square Enix	Bulkhead Interactive	7.4	6.8	0.13	2016	Adventure	1.0	singleplayer	"Turing puzzle
The Turing Test is a first-person puzzle game for one on the Unreal Engine 4. The game was developed by the Bulkhead Interactive studio, and published by Square Enix. The game for a long time was an exclusive for Windows and Xbox where it was released on August 30, 2016. It came on the PS4 only in January 2017.
The story
In the game, the player will take control over the main character - Ava Turing, who is an engineer at the space station. Artificial intelligence awakens her from cryogenic sleep since the team didn’t answer for 450 hours. It was sent with a research mission to Europe - a Jupiter’s satellite. Now Ava as the responsible employee is obliged to sit down in the transport module and find out what happened and why the team is silent.
Turing test
Upon arrival at the station, it turns out that its structure has been changed and to achieve at least some results - it will be necessary to solve puzzles while communicating with Tom - the AI that was left at the disposal of Ave. The player has to reconstruct the picture of the events that happened here by the bit by finding information. The game takes inspiration from the real Turing Test. The Turing test is a real test that the scientist Alan Turing suggested. In the course of it, a person should communicate with somebody without seeing him. During such a conversation, a person should understand with whom he is talking - with another person or with a robot."

No Shepard, no Normandy, and no characters from the previous games, although the ""high-tech"" visual style and the space opera setting are recognizable. Andromeda is set even further in the future, hundreds of years after Mass Effect 3. The protagonist (who is customizable) is a Pathfinder, a member of an expedition to the Andromeda galaxy. She or he bears the surname Ryder and has a twin - whatever gender you choose, it will be the opposite. Ryders traveled billions of miles from our Milky Way galaxy on the space ark Nexus. The ship is carrying thousands of passengers in suspended animation, and the Pathfinders’goal is to find them a habitable planet to call home. 
Andromeda is heavy on the plot, there are many dialogues and cutscenes that may make you feel like watching a movie. The dialogue options usually define how your character is perceived by the others rather than actual plot forks. The action is played like a third-person shooter, allowing you to aim and take cover. Enemy AI reactions will vary, forcing you to employ flexible tactics. Weapons and gear can be improved through an intricate crafting system that requires you to research an upgrade before it can be assembled."

Plot
The main protagonist is Beck, a battle android from the Mighty Numbers series (his number is 9). A virus attack led to a machine uprising, and Mighty No. 9 is among the few robots that were not infected. His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason. He will also assimilate their data to send it back to the lab so that Dr. White could find the cure for the virus. Beck is occasionally assisted by Call, a female robot unaffected by the virus.
Gameplay
The player controls Beck in a 2D environment. Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up. The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him. Gathering Xel from Mighty Numbers, Beck receives new special abilities.
Multiplayer
The game includes a cooperative multiplayer for two, in which the second player controls Call. Her gameplay is very different and is largely defensive as she uses deflector shields to protect herself and Beck."

Plot
The player aims to survive through attacks by armies of demonic monsters for as long as possible. To survive, the player must defeat enemies or avoid contact with them; as the game goes, the monsters become more. The action is taken on a field shrouded in darkness. As a weapon, the protagonist can fire daggers from fingers. 
Gameplay
Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter. As the game starts, the player fetches fire daggers.
Then he is transported to the dark arena, where monsters begin to spawn. The goal is to fight off every appearing enemy. More exotic creatures appear throughout the game; later on, the player can recognize the type of a monster based on the unique noise one makes. There are two alternatives in using the daggers: the protagonist can either fire a shotgun-like blast with a widespread (the player clicks the left mouse button) or fire a continuous stream of them (the player holds the mouse button). The player can die if he touches an enemy, or if he falls off the stage. After that the player can fetch the red crystals dropping from the top of the screen – it lets them upgrade the daggers.

Plot
Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.
Gameplay
Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.
The game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.
Modes
Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options."

The player assumes the role of a minion at the dark lord's service. Tyranny is a spiritual successor to Pillars of Eternity and uses the same graphics engine and gameplay model.
Plot
The game is set in a medieval world called Terratus that was almost completely conquered by Kyros, an immortal evil overlord. No one has ever seen Kyros, but he spent four centuries uniting all the realms under his reign. Kyros rules through his powerful viceroys, the Archons, who, in turn, command their minions called Fatebinders. The protagonist is one of Fatebinders at Kyros' service. He or she is sent to the Tiers province that is torn by the conflict. Two of the Kyros' armies fight each other, and it slows down the conquest. The protagonist has to stop the conflict or to be executed.
Gameplay
The player has to create the main character from scratch and define his or her abilities. The game has no character classes, and the character skills are individual. The process of customization also includes several questions about the character's background. The answers define how the character is perceived by the others and which factions he or she may join. The factions also influence the main character's abilities and the companions the player can recruit. 
Like in Pillars of Eternity, the player has to make difficult decisions that strongly influence the plot and the lives of NPCs. Every dialogue option may lead to a dramatically different outcome."

DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’.
DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills.
With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3.

Plot
The game is set in the world after the literal Biblical Apocalypse that involved the Four Horsemen and a battle between angels and demons. The story of Darksiders III unfolds at the background of the events of two original games. Darksiders III follows Fury, a Horsewoman of the Apocalypse and the sister to the original protagonist, War the Horseman. She goes on a quest given to her by the Charred Council, an institution that is meant to keep the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Fury's mission is to find and annihilate the infamous Seven Deadly Sins. The mighty Lord of the Hollows agrees to help her, although he's obviously pursuing his own goals. He gives Fury the power of the flame.
Gameplay
The player controls Fury from the third person view in an open world. She can use a variety of weapons, including a whip, a sword, and a dagger, as well as her magical abilities. She can also shape-shift into several forms based on elements, such as the flame. Fury also has to solve puzzles and jump platforms. The game reintroduces some of the enemies from the previous parts and introduces new monsters. The enemies in Darksiders III are less numerous but stronger and tougher, taking more effort to beat them."
